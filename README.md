# Project-42
A working contact form collects user input (name, email, message) in HTML, styles it with CSS, validates it using JavaScript, and sends data to a PHP script, which processes and emails it. JavaScript ensures fields are filled correctly, and PHP handles form submission securely, preventing spam with CAPTCHA or honeypot techniques.
